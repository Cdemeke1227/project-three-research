# Project Three: NoSQL Database Model
--------------
## The Model
 - You can view the basic model using this link [StockMarketGame](https://github.com/Cdemeke1227/project-three-research/blob/master/StockMarketGame%20documentation.pdf)

## The Concept
 - We use API to get the stock information such as prices and use functions to update the Database
 - We use Functions to calculate the portfolio values when the react elements are rendered.
